## 📚 Project Overview

[**AnkiDroid**](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android) is an Android app for [Anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki), a powerful flashcards application that aids in learning and memorizing various topics.

### 🎯 **Project Goal**
AnkiDroid currently lacks convenient access to key study management features directly from the device's home screen, hampering user engagement and productivity. To address this inefficiency, I propose implementing widgets for AnkiDroid, focusing on three key areas: Deck Picker, Card Analysis, and Cards Due. These widgets will provide users with quick access to vital study metrics and functionalities, enhancing their study management experience. The solution involves designing intuitive and visually appealing widgets consistent with AnkiDroid's UI/UX guidelines and seamlessly integrating them into the app, ultimately streamlining the study process and boosting user productivity
