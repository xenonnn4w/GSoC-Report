## üåªResults

### Deck Picker Widget
The Deck Picker Widget offers users a convenient display of their decks, showcasing the number of cards that are new, in learning, and due for review, all at a glance. 
This display-only widget allows users to quickly review any deck by simply clicking on it directly from the widget. With a maximum of five decks that can be selected, 
users can reconfigure their widget by holding it down, making it easy to customize their overview. This feature-rich widget provides a seamless way for users to stay
on top of their study progress without having to open the app.

### Card Analysis Widget
The Card Analysis Widget delivers a detailed view of a single deck, presenting key metrics such as the count of new, in-progress, and review cards. Unlike the Deck Picker Widget,
which covers multiple decks, this widget is dedicated to offering an in-depth focus on one specific deck. Users can personalize their widget by pressing and holding it,
making it a straightforward tool for staying engaged with their study routine directly from the home screen, without the need to open the app.
